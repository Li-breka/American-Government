    * Historically important in small communities of Colonial New England.
    * Characterized by town meetings (direct democracy) where citizens discuss and vote on issues.

    * **Council-Manager:** Voters elect a council that appoints a city manager to administer city departments; mayor is largely ceremonial.

* **Zoning:**
    * Dividing a city into zones with regulations on land use (residential, commercial, industrial).
    * Aims to manage land use and development, ensuring compatibility between different uses.

    * A city's authority to exercise jurisdiction beyond its official boundaries (e.g., for sanitation or fire services).
