## Bulleted Outline:

**I. Reform of Bureaucracy:**

- **Three R's:** Reorganization, Reduction, and Removal.
- **Reorganization:** Attempts to reorganize the executive branch through commissions like the Hoover Commissions, but often result in consolidating rather than reducing agencies.
- **Reduction:**  
    - Reducing the number of agencies and personnel.
    - Simplifying the tax code to reduce IRS employees.
    - Deregulation: Reducing the number of regulations produced by agencies.
- **Removal:** Returning decision-making power to state and local governments. 
    - Revival of Federalism: Empowering local governments with greater autonomy. 

**II. Equality and Liberty:**

- **Milton Friedman:** Argues that the original concept of equality meant equality before God and the law, while liberty meant the freedom to shape one's own life.
- **Equality of Outcome:**  The modern concept of equality emphasizes equal outcomes, which can conflict with individual liberty and personal responsibility. 
- **Woodrow Wilson:** Ironically, despite being a progressive, he stated that "the history of liberty is a history of the limitation of governmental power, not the increase of it."

**III. Bureaucratic Overreach and Abuse of Power:**

- **Superfund Legislation:** EPA's authority to clean up hazardous sites, even if the responsible party is unknown.
- **EPA Regulations:** Examples of overly broad regulations, such as those regarding asbestos removal and catalytic converters, which may create more harm than good.
- **Discretionary Authority:**  Agencies have been granted broad discretionary authority, potentially leading to arbitrary decisions and abuse of power.

**IV. Concerns Regarding Government Power:**

- **Unchecked Power:** Our founding fathers feared unchecked government power, as seen in Madison's warning in Federalist No. 47 about the "very definition of tyranny."
- **The Rain of Terror:**  James Bovard, author of "Lost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty," criticizes the FDA for its use of fear and intimidation tactics, comparing it to the French Revolution's "Reign of Terror."
