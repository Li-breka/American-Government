**Concise Summary:**

This class session examined the structure and function of the U.S. federal system, contrasting it with unitary and confederate systems.  The instructor emphasized the founders' intention to distribute power among various levels of government to prevent tyranny.  Key concepts discussed included the different types of governmental powers (denied, concurrent, delegated, and reserved), the significance of the Tenth Amendment, and the implications of the numerous governmental entities within the United States. Homework was assigned to reinforce understanding of these concepts.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Forms of Government:**
    * **Unitary System:**  All governmental power is centralized in a single national government.
    * **Confederate System:**  Power is primarily held by independent states, with a weak central government.
    * **Federal System:** Power is divided and shared between a central government and state/local governments (this is the system used in the U.S.).


* **Reasons for Founders' Choice of Federalism:** The founders chose a federal system to:
    * Prevent the concentration of excessive power in a single entity.
    * Create a system of checks and balances, preventing tyranny (referencing Federalist No. 51).


* **Number of Governments in the U.S.:** The instructor noted that there are approximately 85,000 different governmental entities in the U.S. at various levels.


* **Categorization of Governmental Powers:**
    * **Denied Powers:** Powers explicitly denied to both the federal and state governments (e.g., bills of attainder, ex post facto laws, granting titles of nobility).
    * **Concurrent Powers:** Powers shared by both the federal and state governments (e.g., taxation, borrowing money).
    * **Delegated Powers:** Powers granted to the federal government:
        * **Expressed Powers:** Powers explicitly stated in the Constitution.
        * **Implied Powers:** Powers not explicitly stated but reasonably inferred from the Constitution (based on the Necessary and Proper Clause, Article I, Section 8, Clause 18).  The Supreme Court case *McCulloch v. Maryland* is a key example.
    * **Reserved Powers:** Powers neither delegated to the federal government nor denied to the states; these powers are reserved to the states (10th Amendment).


* **Federal Government's Obligations to States (Article IV):**
    * Guarantee a republican form of government.
    * Protect against invasion and domestic violence.
    * Respect the territorial integrity of each state.
    * Ensure equal representation in the Senate.


* **Homework Assignment:**
    * Read pages 181-182 and 250-251 in the textbook.
    * Read Article IV of the U.S. Constitution.
    * Answer question eight and define the terms "unitary," "confederate," "federal," "full faith and credit," "privileges and immunities," and "extradition" (page 182).
    * Current events assignment due in lesson 62.
