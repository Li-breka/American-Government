## Bulleted Outline:

**I. Introduction:**

*  A bill is a proposed law, with public bills affecting the nation and private bills impacting individuals or groups.
*  Key steps include introduction, committee review, floor debate, and voting.
*  Congressmen can introduce bills, while anyone can propose ideas.

**II. Terminology and Process:**

*  **Resolution:** A formal statement of opinion or determination adopted by a legislative assembly.
    * Simple Resolution: Passed by one house.
    * Joint Resolution: Passed by both houses, deals with matters requiring joint action.
    * Concurrent Resolution: Passed by both houses, deals with matters of internal management.
*  **Origins of Bills:** 
    *  Any individual can propose an idea, but only a congressman can introduce a bill.
    *  Bipartisan support (Republican and Democrat co-sponsorship) strengthens a bill.
*  **House vs. Senate Introduction:**
    *  Senate: Bill is introduced on the floor by a senator.
    *  House: Bill is written and placed in the "Hopper." 
*  **Revenue Bills:**
    *  Only the House of Representatives can introduce bills related to revenue (money) and appropriations (allocating money).

**III. Committee Review:**

*  Committees are considered "Congress at work," reviewing bills closely and potentially pigeonholing (killing) them.
*  **Preventing Pigeonholing:**
    *  Senate: A senator can motion to pull a bill out of committee for a vote.
    *  House: A discharge petition with 218 signatures can force a bill out of committee.
*  **Subcommittees:**
    *  Committees may refer bills to subcommittees for further review.
    *  Once a subcommittee completes its review, the bill is sent back to the full committee for consideration.
*  **Congressional Calendars:**
    *  Bills approved by a committee are placed on a congressional calendar to await a floor vote.

**IV. Floor Debate:**

*  Floor debate occurs separately in the House and Senate.
*  **Importance of Naming:**
    *  A well-chosen bill name can significantly influence public opinion.
    *  Acronyms and emotional language can be used to sway voters.
*  **Limiting Debate:**
    *  Senate: A cloture rule, requiring a three-fifths majority vote (60 senators), can limit filibusters.
    *  House: A Committee of the Whole allows for rapid-fire debate to expedite the process. 

**V. Voting:**

*  **Types of Votes:**
    *  Voice Vote: A simple "aye" or "nay" response, not recorded.
    *  Standing Vote: Members stand to indicate their vote, not recorded.
    *  Roll Call Vote: Each member's vote is recorded and announced.
*  **Override of Presidential Veto:**
    *  Requires a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of Congress.
*  **Public Influence:**
    *  The public can influence the legislative process through lobbying and contacting elected officials.

**VI. Presidential Action:**

*  **Options:**
    *  Sign the bill into law.
    *  Veto the bill (Latin for "I forbid").
    *  Pocket Veto:  President does not sign the bill within 10 days, and Congress adjourns; the bill is considered dead.
*  **Override of Veto:**
    *  Congress can override a veto with a two-thirds majority vote in both houses.

**VII. Homework:**

* Read pages 88-90 in the textbook, up to "Powers of Congress, Delegated and Denied."
* Complete questions 8-12 on page 90.
* Bring patriotic materials and current event information to the next class.
