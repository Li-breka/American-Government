**Concise Summary:**

This lecture focuses on local government, specifically county governments in the United States.  The discussion covers the structure of county government, including variations in terminology across states (parishes in Louisiana, boroughs in Alaska), the roles of key officials (sheriff, assessor, treasurer, county board), and different organizational models (county executive plan vs. county manager plan).  The lecture emphasizes the diversity in county structures and sizes across the US and concludes by assigning homework focused on reading and questions related to county government and a Bible verse.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **County Government:**
    * Largest unit of local government in most states (exceptions: Rhode Island and Connecticut, which have no counties; Hawaii uses "inner states").
    * Variations in names:
        * Parishes (Louisiana)
        * Boroughs (Alaska)
    * County Seat: City where county offices are located.
    * Key Elected Officials: Sheriff, County Assessor, Treasurer, County Board (Board of Commissioners or Board of Supervisors).
        * Sheriff: Law enforcement in rural areas, manages county jails.
        * County Assessor: Appraises property for tax purposes.
        * Treasurer: Manages county funds.
    * County Board: Elected body, sets policies, may have varying sizes (3-7 for Commissioners, 12-100+ for Supervisors).
    * County Government Functions: Wide range of services (law enforcement, public works, public health, elections, etc.).

* **County Government Organizational Models:**
    * **County Executive Plan:**  Voters elect a county executive (supervisor or president) who appoints other officials.  The county board acts as a legislative body.
    * **County Manager Plan:** Voters elect a county board, which hires a professional county manager to handle day-to-day operations and appoint other administrators.  This plan is modeled after the strong mayor-council plan in municipal governments.
