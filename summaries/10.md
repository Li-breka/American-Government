**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Colonial Law**
    * Some New England colonies, like Massachusetts and New Haven, attempted to base their laws on biblical principles.
    * William Blackstone's *Commentaries on the Laws of England* had a significant influence on colonial law. 
    * Blackstone's concept of "higher law" suggested that natural and revealed law are superior to man-made laws.
* **Colonial Government**
    * **House of Burgesses (Virginia, 1619):** The first representative assembly in the colonies. 
    * **Bicameral System:** Modeled after the British Parliament, most colonies adopted a two-house legislature (upper and lower houses). The lower house held more power due to its control over finances.
    * **Unicameral System:** Pennsylvania was the only colony with a single-house legislature.
* **Local Government**
    * **New England:** Town meetings served as a form of direct democracy.
    * **Southern Colonies:** Larger distances and dispersed populations led to county-based governance with elected representatives.
    * **Middle Colonies:** Employed a mix of town and county systems.
