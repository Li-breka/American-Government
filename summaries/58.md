**Concise Summary:**

This class session reviewed the key concepts of federalism in the United States, focusing on the obligations and relationships between states as outlined in Article IV of the Constitution.  The instructor covered the principles of full faith and credit, privileges and immunities, and extradition, providing examples and discussing potential limitations or exceptions.  The lesson also reviewed the different types of governmental systems (unitary, confederate, and federal) and emphasized the importance of understanding the distribution of power between federal and state governments.  The homework assignment involved reading and answering questions related to these topics.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Federal Government's Obligations to States (Article IV):**
    * Guarantee a republican form of government.
    * Protect against invasion and domestic violence.
    * Respect the territorial integrity of each state.
    * Ensure equal representation in the Senate (meaning each state has two senators regardless of population).


* **Interstate Relations:**
    * **Full Faith and Credit Clause:** States must recognize the laws and judicial decisions of other states.  The instructor illustrated this with examples such as marriage licenses and driver's licenses, noting that exceptions might exist, particularly concerning divorce decrees and residency requirements.
    * **Privileges and Immunities Clause:** Citizens of each state should be afforded the same privileges and immunities in other states.  Examples of potential differences based on residency were given, such as hunting and fishing licenses and in-state tuition rates at colleges and universities.
    * **Extradition:**  A fugitive from justice must be returned to the state where the crime was committed upon request. The instructor highlighted that this was not a formal legal requirement until 1987 and used an example of a governor refusing extradition due to differing views on capital punishment.


* **Types of Governmental Systems:**
    * **Unitary:**  A system where the central government holds all the power.
    * **Confederate:** A system where states retain significant power; the central government is weak.
    * **Federal:** A system where power is shared between the central and state governments.


* **Homework Assignment:**
    * Read pages 183-185 (up to "Federalism Today") in the textbook.
    * Answer questions 1-3 on page 188.
    * Define the six terms listed on page 188: dual federalism, doctrine of nullification, *Gibbons v. Ogden*, cooperative federalism, coercive federalism, and new federalism.  Also define preemptions and mandates.
