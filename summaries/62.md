**Concise Summary:**

This class session covered the executive branch of state governments, focusing on the role of the governor.  The lecture detailed the governor's powers (commander-in-chief of the state National Guard, item veto), responsibilities (managing state funds, overseeing public education), and methods of removal (impeachment by the legislature, recall by voters).  Other key state executive officers (lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general, treasurer, auditor) were also discussed, along with the unique variations in gubernatorial elections across different states.  Homework included memorizing a Bible verse and completing textbook questions.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **The Governor:**
    * **Oldest Executive Office:**  The colonial governor is identified as the precursor to the state governor.
    * **Term Length:**  Most states have four-year terms; some have two-year terms.
    * **Commander-in-Chief:** Governors are commander-in-chief of their state's National Guard, but the President of the United States can assume command.
    * **Veto Power:** Most governors have item veto power (the ability to veto specific parts of a bill), unlike the President.
    * **Clemency Powers:** Governors typically have the power to grant pardons, reprieves, commute sentences, and parole prisoners.
    * **Removal from Office:** Governors can be removed through impeachment (by the legislature) or recall (by voters).  Rod Blagojevich (Illinois) and Gray Davis (California) were mentioned as examples of impeached and recalled governors, respectively.


* **Other State Executive Officers:**
    * **Lieutenant Governor:** Often succeeds the governor if the office becomes vacant; in about half of the states, they run as a team with the governor.
    * **Secretary of State:**  Maintains state records and the state seal.
    * **Attorney General:** Serves as the state's chief legal officer and prosecutor.
    * **Treasurer:**  Manages state funds.
    * **Auditor:** Oversees the proper spending of state funds.
    * **Superintendent of Public Instruction/Commissioner of Education:** Oversees public education.


* **Gubernatorial Elections:**
    * **Term Limits:** Vary by state.
    * **Election Methods:**
        * **Plurality:**  The candidate with the most votes wins (45 states).
        * **Runoff:** If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff election is held between the top two candidates (some states).
        * **Legislative Selection:** In some states (Mississippi and Virginia), the legislature chooses the governor if no candidate receives a majority of the votes.
    * **Candidate Selection:** Most states use primaries; some use conventions.  In many states, the governor and lieutenant governor run as a team.


* **Key Terms:** Gubernatorial (related to the governor),  Plurality, Majority, Item Veto, Clemency, Pardon, Reprieve, Commute, Parole, Ex Officio, Recall, Impeachment.
