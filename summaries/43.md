## Bulleted Outline:

**I. Federal Courts**

* **Types of Courts:**
    * **Constitutional Courts:** Established by Article III of the Constitution, these courts have jurisdiction over cases involving the Constitution, federal laws, treaties, and certain specific types of cases (e.g., those involving ambassadors, disputes between states). Judges on these courts serve for life.
    * **Legislative Courts:** Created by Congress to handle appeals from specific cases arising from the powers granted to Congress. Judges on these courts serve fixed terms, typically 10-15 years.
* **Jurisdiction:** The authority of a court to hear and decide a case.  Two factors determine jurisdiction: subject matter and parties involved. 
* **11th Amendment:** Prohibits a state from being sued in federal court by its own citizens, citizens of another state, or a foreign country.
* **Nominating and Confirming Judges:**
    * President nominates judges.
    * Senate confirms or rejects the nominee.
    * The American Bar Association provides ratings of potential nominees based on their qualifications.
    * Political considerations play a significant role in the nomination process.
    * Senatorial courtesy gives senators considerable influence in the confirmation process.

**II. Judicial Philosophies**

* **Interpretivism:**  Judges should strictly interpret the Constitution and apply its meaning to the case at hand.
* **Non-interpretivism/Judicial Activism:** Judges can go beyond the text of the Constitution to interpret and apply its principles in new ways.
* **Original Intent:** Judges should consider the original intent of the Constitution's framers when interpreting its meaning. 
* **Contextualism:** Judges should consider the context of the case and the specific circumstances in interpreting the Constitution.

**III. The Supreme Court**

* The only federal court that must exist, established by the Constitution (Article III).
* Congress created other inferior courts (district courts, courts of appeal).
* The Judiciary Act of 1789 established the structure of the federal court system.

**IV. Importance of Impartiality**

* Judges should not favor individuals or be influenced by personal biases.
* Scripture emphasizes the need for judges to be impartial and not to accept bribes.
* The lecture uses examples of how even seemingly small actions can be interpreted as bias, highlighting the difficulty of maintaining impartiality.
