## Lesson Notes: Representation in the Legislative Process

**Concise Summary:** This lesson dives into the roles and responsibilities of representatives in the legislative process. It discusses the twofold purpose of representatives: to protect constituents from harmful legislation and to promote beneficial legislation. The class explores key qualities of effective representatives, including character, trustworthiness, honesty, consistency, and competence. They differentiate between two views of representation: the trustee view, where representatives vote based on their own judgment, and the delegate view, where representatives vote according to their constituents' desires. The lesson also examines the congressional responsibility of oversight, including the use of oversight committees, sunset laws, and the concept of legislative veto (deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court).
