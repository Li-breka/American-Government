**Concise Summary:**

This lecture focuses on the structure and function of state legislatures, drawing parallels with the federal government.  Key aspects covered include the roles of presiding officers (Speaker of the House, President of the Senate), voting methods (voice, standing, teller, roll call), and citizen participation in lawmaking through initiatives and referendums. The class also reviewed the legislative process, highlighting the stages a bill goes through to become law, including committee review and gubernatorial veto power.  Finally, the differences between state and federal legislative processes were emphasized.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **State Legislature Structure:**
    * Resembles the US Congress; 49 states have bicameral legislatures (Nebraska is unicameral).
    * Lower house (House of Representatives) elects its Speaker.
    * Upper house (Senate) is presided over by:
        * Lieutenant Governor (23 states)
        * Leader chosen from Senate's own ranks (27 states)
        * President pro tempore (serves when Lieutenant Governor is absent, typically from majority party).
    * Other key officers:  Sergeant at Arms, Doorkeeper, Pages.
    * Committee System: Standing committees (15-20), Joint committees (members from both houses).

* **Legislative Process:**
    * Similar to federal process: Bill introduction, committee review, floor debate, voting in both houses, gubernatorial approval (veto power, except in North Carolina).
    * Bill introduction can be initiated by legislators, citizens, interest groups, or the executive branch.
    * Potential for joint committee to resolve discrepancies between House and Senate versions of a bill.
    * Veto override typically requires a two-thirds majority.

* **Voting Methods:**
    * Voice vote
    * Standing vote
    * Teller vote (rarely used; may or may not be recorded)
    * Roll call vote (permanently recorded).

* **Voter Participation:**
    * Initiative: Citizens propose laws directly.  South Dakota was the first state to allow this (1898).
    * Referendum: Voters approve or reject laws proposed by the legislature.  Mandatory referendums require voter approval for specific legislation.
    * Constituent Power: State legislators' power to propose constitutional amendments.

* **Key Court Cases:**
    * *Baker v. Carr*: Federal government involvement in state apportionment.
    * *Reynolds v. Sims*:  Federal requirement for population-based apportionment in both houses.

* **Quiz and Homework:**
    * Announced quiz on material covered in the lecture and assigned reading (page 223).
    * Homework: Read pages 203-206 (up to "Local Government"), answer questions 1-5 on page 206, and complete Bible verse assignment (Lesson 68).
