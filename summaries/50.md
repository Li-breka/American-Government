## Bulleted Outline:

**I. The First Amendment**

* **Establishment Clause:**
    * Prohibits the establishment of a national religion or state church.
    *  Prevents the granting of legal preference to any church or denomination. 
    *  The intent was not absolute separation of religion and government.
    *  The court has ruled in favor of some religious displays on public land, like a menorah, but not others, like a nativity scene displayed alone. 
    *  Congress can employ paid chaplains to open sessions with prayer, yet children are often discouraged from praying in public schools.
    *  The "Wall of Separation"  interpretation emerged later, not from the original intent of the Founders. 
* **Free Exercise Clause:**
    *  Guarantees the individual's right to worship God freely.
    *  The Founders intended to protect religious liberty and conscience.
    *  The court has ruled against some religious practices, like polygamy, but upheld others, like animal sacrifice and abstaining from work on Sunday.
* **Limitations on Religious Freedom:**
    *  The free exercise of religion is limited in scope by common standards of decency.
    * The Lemon Test: 
        *  The law must have a secular purpose. 
        *  The primary effect must be neutral toward religion. 
        *  The law must not foster an excessive entanglement of government with religion. 
    *  The Lemon Test is considered vague and controversial.
