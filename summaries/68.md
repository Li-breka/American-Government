**Bulleted Outline:**

* **State and Local Government Revenue:**
    * 25% of all tax revenue goes to state and local governments.
    * **Major Sources:**
        * Sales Tax (most important for states; regressive tax—disproportionately affects lower-income individuals).  General sales tax and selective sales taxes (e.g., on gasoline).
        * Income Tax (individual and corporate; progressive tax—higher earners pay higher rates; 43 states have individual income tax, 7 do not).
        * Property Tax (chief source for local governments; assessed value is typically a percentage of market value; mills are used as a unit of measurement for tax rates).
        * Inheritance Tax (tax on inherited wealth; also known as death tax).
        * Severance Tax (tax on the extraction of natural resources).
    * **Non-Tax Revenue:** Tolls, sale of public land, borrowing.

* **State and Local Government Expenditures:**
    * **Largest Expenditures:** Education, highways, hospitals, public welfare.

* **Tax Systems:**
    * Progressive Tax: Higher income = higher tax rate.
    * Regressive Tax: Lower income = higher tax burden (as a percentage of income).

* **Other Key Concepts:**

    *  The need for a balance of power between communities and levels of government.
    *  The high cost of providing public services.
