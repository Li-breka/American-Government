## Concise Summary:

This class session continued the discussion of the executive branch, focusing on the federal bureaucracy and its various organizations. The lecture explored the historical development of the bureaucracy, starting with a small, tightly controlled system under George Washington, transitioning through the patronage-based spoil system of Andrew Jackson, and finally culminating in the establishment of the merit system through the Pendleton Act of 1883. The session then categorized the different types of agencies within the bureaucracy: departments, independent executive agencies, independent regulatory agencies, and government corporations. The lecture also discussed the concerns surrounding the bureaucracy, including the potential for excessive regulations, lack of accountability, and the potential for abuse of power.
