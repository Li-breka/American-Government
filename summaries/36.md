## Concise Summary:

This class session focused on the executive branch of the US government, specifically the bureaucracy. The lecture covered the historical evolution of the federal bureaucracy, starting with George Washington's small, tightly controlled system and moving through the patronage-based spoil system of Andrew Jackson, the attempted implementation of a merit system (ultimately resulting in the assassination of President Garfield), and the eventual passage of the Pendleton Act of 1883, which established the Civil Service Commission and brought the merit system into practice. The lecture also discussed the growth of the bureaucracy, the various types of organizations within it (departments, independent agencies, and government corporations), and the potential pitfalls of an increasingly large and powerful bureaucracy.
