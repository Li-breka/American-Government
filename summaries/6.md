**Concise Summary:**

This American Government class examines various democratic systems, contrasting direct democracy (rule by direct popular vote) with indirect democracy (representative government).  The lecture analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of direct democracy, using examples like ancient Athens and New England town meetings, highlighting its impracticality for large, diverse populations.  The lesson then contrasts pure democracy with the constitutional republic established in the United States, emphasizing the limitations imposed by a written constitution to prevent mob rule and protect individual rights. The lecture concludes with a homework assignment focusing on the differences between various forms of government.
