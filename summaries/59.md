**Concise Summary:**

This class session reviewed different forms of federalism in the United States, starting with the founders' preference for dual federalism and tracing its evolution through cooperative, coercive, and new federalism.  The discussion included the impact of the 16th Amendment (income tax), the role of federal grants (categorical and block), and the concept of unfunded mandates.  The instructor also reviewed key Supreme Court cases that shaped the balance of power between federal and state governments (*Gibbons v. Ogden*, *McCulloch v. Maryland*). Homework involved further reading and review questions.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Types of Federalism:**
    * **Dual Federalism:**  Early American system with a clear division of power between federal and state governments. This was the system favored by the founders.
    * **Cooperative Federalism:**  Increased federal-state cooperation, often facilitated by federal grants (post-16th Amendment).
    * **Coercive Federalism:**  Federal government uses penalties to force states to comply with federal programs.
    * **New Federalism:**  Attempts to shift power back to state governments (Nixon and Reagan administrations).


* **Key Supreme Court Cases:**
    * **Gibbons v. Ogden:** Broadened the federal government's power to regulate interstate commerce.
    * **McCulloch v. Maryland:** Established the principle of implied powers, allowing the federal government to exercise powers not explicitly listed in the Constitution.


* **Funding and Federal Influence:**
    * **16th Amendment:** Enabled the federal income tax, providing significant funding for federal programs and grants.
    * **Federal Grants:**  A primary tool used by the federal government to influence state policies.
        * **Categorical Grants:**  Funds for specific purposes, often with conditions attached.
        * **Block Grants:** Funds for broader purposes, allowing states more flexibility.
    * **Unfunded Mandates:** Federal requirements imposed on states without providing the necessary funding, creating a burden on states.  The instructor mentioned the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act as a response to this.
