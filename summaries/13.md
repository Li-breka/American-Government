## American Revolution Class Notes

**Concise Summary:** This lecture focuses on the escalating tensions between the American colonies and Great Britain leading up to the American Revolution. Key topics include King George III's influence on Parliament, the colonists' reactions to various taxes (Stamp Act, Tea Act), the philosophical underpinnings of the colonists' resistance, and the significant events that marked the road to independence (Stamp Act Congress, Boston Tea Party, Intolerable Acts, First and Second Continental Congresses, Olive Branch Petition, Prohibitory Act). 

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **George III and Parliament:** 
    * George III sought to restore the monarch's power by influencing Parliament through supporting loyal members (King's Men).
    * This manipulation was met with resistance in both England (e.g., William Pitt, Edmund Burke) and the colonies.

* **Taxation Without Representation:**
    * Colonists protested taxation without representation in Parliament, citing their charters which placed them under the King's authority, not Parliament's.
    * The Stamp Act, requiring a tax stamp on various documents, exemplified this issue and led to the Stamp Act Congress.

* **Edmund Burke and Conservative Principles:**
    * Edmund Burke, an Irishman representing England, criticized Parliament for pushing the colonists to defend their rights.
    * He argued for traditional English liberties and the importance of religion and morality in good governance, becoming known as the "Father of Modern Conservatism."

* **Escalating Tensions and Colonial Resistance:**
    * The Stamp Act Congress issued the Declaration of Rights and Grievances, marking a united colonial protest.
    * Though Parliament repealed the Stamp Act, they passed other punitive laws, such as those targeting the tea industry.
    * The Boston Tea Party, a protest against these unfair taxes, led to the Intolerable Acts, further isolating Boston.

* **Road to Revolution:**
    * The First Continental Congress convened, pledging loyalty to the King but protesting Parliament's interference, opting for boycotts of British goods.
    * The Battles of Lexington and Concord marked a turning point, leading to the Second Continental Congress.

* **Second Continental Congress and the March to War:**
    * The Second Continental Congress formed a unified colonial government, raising an army, appointing George Washington as Commander-in-Chief, and issuing money.
    * Despite the escalating situation, the colonists sent the Olive Branch Petition to King George III seeking reconciliation.
    * The King's refusal to receive the petition and his declaration of the colonies' rebellion, coupled with the Prohibitory Act, effectively dissolved the relationship and marked the beginning of the war.
