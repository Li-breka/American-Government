### Concise Summary: 
This lecture focused on the structure of the US government as laid out in the Constitution. It emphasized the importance of the Constitution as the supreme law of the land and its role in limiting government power.

The lecture also highlighted the influence of Christian thought on the Founding Fathers and their understanding of human nature.

###  Bulleted Outline:

**I. Limits on Government Power:**

*   The Founding Fathers, influenced by their Christian faith and understanding of human nature, built safeguards into the Constitution to prevent tyranny. They believed that humans are prone to abusing power, making limitations necessary.
*   Three primary safeguards were established:
    *   **Federalism:**  The division of power between national and state governments.
    *   **Separation of Powers:** Dividing governmental authority among three branches: Legislative, Executive, and Judicial.
    *   **Checks and Balances:** A system where each branch exercises some control over the others, preventing any one branch from becoming too powerful.

**II. Federalism:**

*   Defined as the division of power between national (federal) and state governments.
*   **Delegated Powers:** Powers specifically granted to the federal government by the Constitution (e.g., coining money, interstate commerce, declaring war).
*   **Reserved Powers:** Powers not granted to the federal government, nor prohibited to the states, are reserved for the states (e.g., marriage and divorce laws, education, driving regulations).
*   **Concurrent Powers:** Powers shared by both federal and state governments (e.g., taxation).

**III. Separation of Powers & Checks and Balances:**

*   **Legislative Branch (Congress):** Makes the laws. Can override presidential vetoes with a two-thirds majority vote. Approves presidential appointments to the judicial branch.
    *   Comprised of the Senate and the House of Representatives.
*   **Executive Branch (President):** Executes (carries out) the laws. Can veto laws passed by Congress. Appoints judges to the judicial branch.
*   **Judicial Branch (Courts):** Interprets laws according to the Constitution. Can declare laws unconstitutional.

**IV. Amending the Constitution:**

*   The process of amending the Constitution is designed to be difficult, reflecting the significance of any changes made.
*   **Two methods for proposal:** 
    *   By a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress.
    *   By a national convention called by Congress at the request of two-thirds of the states (never been used).
*   **Two methods for ratification:**
    *   By the legislatures of three-fourths of the states.
    *   By conventions in three-fourths of the states (used only once for the 21st Amendment).

**V. Articles of the Constitution:**

*   **Article 1-3:** Outline the structure and powers of the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches, respectively.
*   **Article 4:** Defines the relationship between states and between the states and the federal government (Federalism).
*   **Article 5:**  Describes the process for amending the Constitution.
*   **Article 6:** Establishes the Constitution as the supreme law of the land (Supremacy Clause).
*   **Article 7:** Details the process for ratifying the Constitution.

**VI. Key Figures and Quotes:**

*   **Charles de Montesquieu:** Author of "The Spirit of the Laws," which argues that the separation of powers is crucial to prevent tyranny.
*   **John Cotton:**  Puritan minister who used the analogy of a tethered beast to illustrate how humans will push the boundaries of any limitations placed upon them.
*   **Daniel Webster:**  Statesman who emphasized the importance of maintaining constitutional restraints and a clear division of powers to safeguard liberty. He argued against oversimplifying government, warning that it could lead to despotism.

**VII. Homework:**
