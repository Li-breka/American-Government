**Concise Summary:**

This class session was structured as a game simulating a presidential election using the Electoral College system.  Students earned electoral votes by correctly answering questions about the U.S. judicial system, legal terminology, constitutional amendments, and significant Supreme Court cases. The game was highly interactive, with students from different regions competing against each other. The homework assignment focused on preparation for an upcoming test.

**Bulleted Outline:**

The core of the class was a game where students answered questions to gain electoral votes for their team (red or blue, based on geographic location).  The questions covered a wide range of topics, making a comprehensive list impractical. However, the key areas covered included:

* **Court Structure and Procedures:**  Questions covered the organization of the federal court system, including the types of courts, their jurisdictions (original and appellate), and the process of judicial appointments.  The American Bar Association's role was also mentioned.
* **Legal Terminology:**  Many questions focused on defining key legal terms such as jurisdiction, writ of certiorari, writ of mandamus, amicus curiae brief,  exclusionary rule,  indictment, acquittal, and hung jury.
* **Constitutional Law and Amendments:** Questions tested knowledge of specific constitutional amendments, often without explicit mention of their content, focusing instead on their subject matter (e.g., freedom of speech, right to bear arms, protection against cruel and unusual punishment).
* **Supreme Court Cases:** Several questions involved knowledge of important Supreme Court cases and their impact, including *Marbury v. Madison* (judicial review) and *Roe v. Wade* (judicial activism).
* **Evidence and Trial Procedures:**  Students were asked to identify types of evidence (circumstantial and demonstrative) and procedures related to grand juries and trial juries.
* **Electoral College:**  Questions were asked about how the Electoral College works.

**Homework Assignment:**

* Study chapters 8 and 9 for Test 4 in the next lesson.


**Note:** Due to the game format, this outline groups similar question types rather than listing every individual question and answer.  The transcript shows several instances where student answers were incorrect but accepted within the game's context.
