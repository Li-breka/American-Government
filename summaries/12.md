**Bulleted Outline:**

* **The Great Awakening (1730s-1760s):**
    * A spiritual revival that swept through the American colonies.
    * Key figures: 
        * **Jonathan Edwards:** American preacher known for his fiery sermons, such as "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God," which challenged complacency and urged a return to God. 
        * **George Whitefield:** Influential English evangelist who also preached in America, further fueling the revival.
* **Impact of the Great Awakening:**
    * **Religious Freedom:**
        * Promoted the separation of church and state.
        * Emphasized local churches supported by members, not government funding.
        * Reinforced the belief that true Christianity flourishes without government control. 
    * **Economic Impact:**
        * Reinforced the Puritan work ethic.
        * Encouraged stewardship of resources and financial independence.
    * **Political Impact:**
        *  Promoted the idea of equality before God, leading to calls for equal political participation regardless of religious views. 
        * Fostered a belief in equal justice and law, laying the groundwork for future demands for self-governance.
* **Early Steps Toward Colonial Unity:**
    * **New England Confederation (1643):**
        * The first significant attempt at political unity among colonies (Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven).
        * Formed for mutual defense against threats from Native Americans.
        * Important to note: It was voluntary, temporary (dissolved when the threat subsided), and did not require colonies to relinquish individual rights.
     * **Albany Plan (1754):**
        * Proposed by Benjamin Franklin.
        * Called for a centralized government to manage colonial affairs, including defense, laws, and taxes. 
        * Ultimately rejected by the colonies, who were reluctant to cede power to a central authority. 

**Key Takeaways:**
* The Great Awakening was a pivotal event in shaping American ideals about religion, individual liberty, and self-governance. 
* Early attempts at colonial unity, though limited, reveal a growing awareness of shared interests and a desire for greater autonomy from England.
