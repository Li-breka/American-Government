## Concise Summary:

This lecture delves into the intricacies of the Electoral College, the system used to elect the President of the United States. It explains how the electoral votes are allocated based on a state's representation in Congress, and how the winner-take-all system can result in a candidate winning the presidency despite losing the popular vote. The lecture also discusses the 22nd Amendment, which limits a president to two terms, and explores exceptions to this rule related to the death or resignation of a president.

## Bulleted Outline:

**I. Presidential Term and Tenure:**

* A presidential term is four years.
* The 22nd Amendment limits presidents to two terms (eight years).
* A president can serve up to ten years in office if they become president due to a vacancy created by death or resignation.

**II. The Electoral College:**

* Each state receives a number of electoral votes based on the number of its senators (two for every state) and representatives in the House of Representatives.
* Political parties in each state choose electors who are pledged to vote for their party's candidates.
* A candidate needs to secure 270 electoral votes to win the presidency, which is one more than half the total number of electoral votes (538).

**III. Winner Takes All:**

* In most states, the candidate who receives the most votes in the state (popular vote) receives all of the state's electoral votes.
* This system can lead to a candidate winning the presidency even if they lose the popular vote nationwide.

**IV. Minority President:**

* A candidate who wins the Electoral College but does not receive a majority of the popular votes is considered a minority president.

**V. Plurality:**

* Plurality refers to the highest number of votes received, but not necessarily a majority.

* The 12th Amendment changed the process of electing the president and vice president, ensuring that they are elected on the same ticket.
