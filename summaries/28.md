**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Delegated Powers:** Congress is granted a broad range of powers through the Constitution, categorized as express and implied.
    * **Express Powers:** Found in Article 1, Section 8, Clauses 1-17, these powers are explicitly stated in the Constitution.
    * **Implied Powers:** Derived from the Necessary and Proper Clause (Article 1, Section 8, Clause 18), these powers are not explicitly stated but are considered necessary to carry out the expressed powers.
* **Powers of the House of Representatives:**
    * Originating all revenue bills.
    * Selecting a president from the top three candidates if the Electoral College fails to reach a majority.
    * Conferring charges of impeachment against a federal official.
* **Powers of the Senate:**
    * Choosing a vice president from the top two candidates if the Electoral College fails to reach a majority (this is rarely used due to the 22nd Amendment).
    * Approving all presidential appointments.
    * Trying all cases of impeachment.
    * Approving all presidential treaties.
    * **Senatorial Courtesy:** A custom where the Senate defers to the opinion of a senator from the same state as a judicial nominee and of the same political party as the president.
* **Impeachment Process:**
    * The House of Representatives formally accuses a federal official of wrongdoing.
    * The Senate conducts a trial to determine guilt or innocence, requiring a two-thirds vote for conviction.
    * The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides over the trial if the president is being impeached.
* **Powers Denied to Congress:**
    * **Bills of Attainder:** Laws that punish a person without a trial.

    * **Capitation Tax:** A tax levied directly on individuals (with the exception of income tax).
    * **Granting Titles of Nobility:** This is meant to prevent the rise of a monarchy.
* **Importance of Limiting Government Power:**
    * The Founding Fathers believed that government power was necessary but that too much power could threaten individual liberties.
    * They emphasized the need for a balance of power between the different branches of government.

**Definitions:**

* **Writ of Habeas Corpus:** A court order requiring a detained person to be brought before a court to determine if their detention is lawful.
