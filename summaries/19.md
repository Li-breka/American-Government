## American Government Class Notes

### Concise Summary: 

This lecture reviewed the process of ratifying the United States Constitution and the key players involved. The class explored the differing perspectives of the Federalists, who supported the Constitution, and the Anti-Federalists, who opposed it, highlighting the Anti-Federalists' concerns about potential threats to individual liberties.  The ratification process, outlined in Article VII of the Constitution, required approval from nine of the thirteen original states. Key milestones included Delaware being the first to ratify and New Hampshire being the ninth, securing its enactment.
