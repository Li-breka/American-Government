**Concise Summary:**

This class session analyzed how the Supreme Court and Congress have influenced the balance of power between the federal government and states, shifting away from the original intent of dual federalism.  The lecture examined the Supreme Court's application of the 14th Amendment, Congressional actions through preemption and federal grants, and the issue of unfunded mandates.  The instructor discussed the impact of these actions on state autonomy and the potential for unintended consequences, referencing relevant court cases and historical examples.  Homework involved further reading and answering review questions.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **Shift in Federal-State Power Dynamics:** The core theme is the erosion of states' rights and the expansion of federal power, moving away from the founders' intended system of dual federalism.

* **Supreme Court's Role:**
    * The Supreme Court's application of the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause to incorporate the Bill of Rights to the states (starting around 1925) significantly reduced states' ability to act independently of federal mandates.
    * *Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority*: This case is presented as a key example where the Supreme Court limited state autonomy by requiring states to adhere to federal minimum wage standards.  This is seen as undermining the 10th Amendment's reservation of powers to the states.

* **Congressional Actions:**
    * **Preemption:** Federal laws superseding state laws on similar subjects.  Examples cited include water quality regulations, OSHA standards, and the Clean Air Act.  The instructor used the analogy of a homeowner's association dictating interior paint colors to illustrate the limitations imposed by preemption.
    * **Federal Grants:**  The use of federal grants (categorical and block grants) to influence state policies.  The instructor highlighted that these grants often come with "mandates" or "conditions of aid," limiting state autonomy.

* **Unfunded Mandates:**  Federal laws requiring states to implement programs without providing the necessary funding, creating a significant burden on states. The Motor Voter Law is discussed as an example. The Unfunded Mandate Reform Act is mentioned as an attempt to mitigate the issue.

* **The "Nine Scariest Words":**  The instructor quotes Ronald Reagan's statement, "I'm from the government and I'm here to help," as a summary of the potential overreach of federal power.

* **Key Terms:**  Preemption, Unfunded Mandates,  Dual Federalism,  14th Amendment (Due Process Clause), *Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority*,  *United States v. Lopez* (mentioned as a case that partially reversed this trend),  Federal Grants (categorical and block),  Mandates/Conditions of Aid.

* **Homework Assignment:**
    * Read pages 190-194 (up to "State Executive Officers") in the textbook.
    * Answer questions 1-7 on page 194.
