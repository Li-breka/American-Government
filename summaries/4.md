**Concise Summary:**

This American Government class explores the origins and purpose of civil government, focusing on the source of its authority (God) and its role in protecting the innocent and punishing the guilty.  The lecture differentiates between revealed law (explicitly from God) and natural law (discernible through nature), contrasting these with man's law (positive law). The importance of submitting to authority, even when flawed, is stressed.  The lesson concludes with instructions for a current events assignment and upcoming quizzes.
