**Concise Summary:**

This American Government class discusses Christians' responsibilities toward their government, focusing on the biblical mandates to pray for and submit to authority (Romans 13:1-7). The lecture analyzes the concept of separation of church and state, clarifying that it does not prohibit religious expression in public life but rather prevents the government from establishing or inhibiting religious practice.  The importance of individual moral character and spiritual renewal in maintaining a strong government is stressed, contrasting this with the dangers of socialism and the potential for mob rule in democracies.  The lesson concludes with a homework assignment.
