**Concise Summary:**

This class session focused on state legislatures, covering their structure, functions, and the process of electing and removing state legislators. Key topics included the unique unicameral legislature of Nebraska, the impact of *Baker v. Carr* and *Reynolds v. Sims* on state apportionment, and the reasons for high turnover among state legislators (heavy responsibilities, low pay, political challenges).  The lesson also reviewed methods for proposing and ratifying constitutional amendments (initiative and referendum) and the various powers of state legislatures. Homework involved reading and answering questions from the textbook, as well as memorizing a Bible verse.

**Bulleted Outline:**

* **State Legislature Structure:**
    * **Nebraska:** The only state with a unicameral (one-house) legislature, referred to as the "Senate."
    * **Bicameral:**  Most states have bicameral (two-house) legislatures, consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives.  The instructor noted that no state legislature is larger than the U.S. Congress.
    * **Apportionment:** The process of allocating seats in the legislature based on population. *Baker v. Carr* (1962) and *Reynolds v. Sims* (1964) established federal judicial review of state apportionment plans. The instructor highlighted the hypocrisy of the *Reynolds v. Sims* ruling given the structure of the U.S. Senate.


* **State Legislators:**
    * **Election:** State legislators are elected by popular vote.
    * **Term Length:** Senators typically serve four-year terms, representatives two-year terms.  Session frequency varies by state (annual, biennial, or continuous).
    * **High Turnover:**  High turnover is attributed to heavy responsibilities, low pay, and the challenges of political life.
    * **Qualifications:**  Age, U.S. citizenship, and state residency requirements vary by state and legislative chamber.
    * **Removal:** Legislators can be removed through impeachment.

    * **Constituent Power:** The power to propose constitutional amendments.


* **Amendment Process:**
    * **Initiative:** Citizens can propose amendments by gathering signatures and placing them on the ballot.
